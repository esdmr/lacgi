# LaCGI

LaTeX-based HTTP request router via CGI. Not production ready. Will never be.
Please don’t use. It’s only a joke.

## Ingredients

You likely already have most of the ingredients you'll need. Here's what to add
to your grocery list:

- Python 3 + HTTP module (You can substitute it with Apache or nginx)
- Bourne Again Shell (`bash`)
- $\LaTeX$ compiler ($\text{pdf }\LaTeX$)

## Instructions

- Preheat your terminal to 200 °C
- Lubricate your favorite shell lightly with canola oil
- Pour `./index` in the shell and place inside the terminal
- Let it bake for as long as you have time to waste (It most probably, maybe,
  dubitably, unlikely, uncertainly will not catch on fire)
- Serve with a cup of bleach
